         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>WHO he was that ſent you the firſt Queſtions about Infant-Baptiſm, I know not; whether he was an Antipedo-Baptiſt, or a Pedo-Baptiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is a Queſtion: but your calling upon all who had any Doubts about it, to ſend in their Objections, argues a great degree of Confidence of your Ability, of doing more than all before: For 'tis ſtrange you ſhould attempt to call for all our Objections, when it appears you intended to write but one half Sheet of Paper in Anſwer to them; as if you could do that in a few Lines, which others, as learned as your ſelves, could never yet do in great Volumes; this ſavours (as ſome judg) of great Pride, and caſts much Contempt upon you, and leſſens your Reputation among wiſe Men who are for Pedo Baptiſm, as well as others. And yet after all the great and mighty noiſe, you have not ſo much as in the leaſt touched the chief Queſtions, which, to my knowledg, were ſent you near a Fortnight before your ſaid <hi>Mercury</hi> came forth. And therefore to ſhew how diſingenuous you have been herein, I thought it might not be amiſs to ſpend two or three ſpare hours upon your <hi>Mercury.</hi>

               </div>
               <div n="1" type="question">
                  <p>1. The firſt Queſtion you pretend to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is this, <hi>i. e. Whether Baptiſm (as it is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57438:3"/> commonly taught) is the proper and natural Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type of Circumciſion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> As to what you ſpeak of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of Nations. Languiſms, and of Men being ignorant of Radixes, or Original Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications in Langages, ſeems remote to the buſineſs, and ſerves for little elſe than to blot Paper, or rather to darken Counſel: Certainly the Ordinance of Baptiſm, one of the two great Sacraments of the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth not lie ſo obſcure in God's Word, either what it is, or who are the proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects thereof, that Men muſt be at a loſs about it, unleſs they underſtand the Radixes, or original Significations of Languages. But to proceed, you would, it ſeems, have Baptiſm to be the proper Antitype of Circumciſion in ſome reſpect and not in others.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From the Cuſtoms of the Jews in proſelyting the Gentiles into their Religion: ſo far you ſay indeed Circumciſion was not a Type, but a continuance of a Cuſtom. Now how abſurd and ridiculous that is which you affirm upon this account, may appear to all. Will you aſſert and ſtand by it, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was a Jewiſh Cuſtom, and ſo no pure Goſpel-Inſtitution? Doubtleſs, if ſo, the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees might have ſoon given our Saviour a ready Anſwer to his great Queſtion, <hi>viz. The Baptiſm of</hi> John, <hi>whether is it from Heaven, or of Men?</hi> Mat. 21.25. Certainly there was no Baptiſm of this nature of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, before <hi>John</hi> received it from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: But, ſay you, <hi>If</hi> John <hi>Baptiſt undertook any new way of proſelyting the Jews into the Goſpel, they had not only ſtruggled with the Oppoſition of his new Doctrine, but alſo of his new Practice; therefore</hi> (ſay you) <hi>it was that this Cuſtom was continued, and had the Super-addition of the full force of Baptiſm,</hi> viz. <hi>a Conſignation or Seal of the Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> As you confeſs his Doctrine was new, ſo was his Baptiſm no doubt; for, as our Annotators obſerve, his Baptiſm was part of his Doctrine. Pray, what was the Doctrine he preach'd? was it not Baptiſm of Repentance for the Remiſſion of Sins? <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. Moreover, we do not read they were more diſpleaſed with his new Doctrine, than with his new Practice.</p>
                  <p>2. But what Authority have you to affirm, Goſpel-Baptiſm was but the continuance of a Jewiſh Cuſtom, or was a Legal Rite, or rather indeed a human Tradition? for 'tis evident the Jews were not required, or commanded of God to baptize their Proſelytes, or others; for Circumciſion was the only Rite by which Proſelytes (who were Males) were added to the Jewiſh Church, as we find God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Abraham.</hi> And if Baptiſm had been ſo frequently practiſed amongſt the Jews, as you aſſert, wherefore did the Phariſees ſay to <hi>John, Why doſt thou baptize, if thou art not that Chriſt, nor</hi> Elias? <hi>John</hi> 1.25. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Baptiſm is directly called a Principle of the Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1,2. which Doctrine our Saviour ſaith he received from his Father. If it be a Principle of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, it follows undeniably, he inſtituted it, and gave it forth. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, if Baptiſm was practiſed all along a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews, I argue, either they practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it as a Moſaical Rite, or elſe as a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own; not, ſay I, as a Moſaical Rite, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> never commanded them ſo to do; for he ſpeaks nothing of it, and yet declared all things God commanded him; and did every thing according to the Pattern ſhewed him in the Mount. And if it was a human Jewiſh Tradition, what is become of one of the great Sacraments of the New Teſtament? Muſt it be look'd upon from henceforth to be nothing elſe than the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of a Jewiſh Tradition taken out of their fabulous and erronious <hi>Talmud?</hi> What kind of poiſonous Stuff is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>is you trouble the World with? What tho the Jews, who had made the Commandments of God void through their Traditions, did practiſe ſome ſuch thing; Muſt you affirm Goſpel-Baptiſm in its Riſe and Original ſprung from their Cuſtom? And becauſe they baptized Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes both Men, Women and Children, muſt Chriſtians do ſo too? Sure the Cuſtom of the Romiſh Church in baptizing of Infants, as a human Tradition, is every way of as good
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57438:3"/> Authority to warrant us ſo to do, as the Cuſtom of the unbelieving Jews. But pray take what a Learned Pedo-Baptiſt, and a Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> hath ſaid in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this vain Conceit; 'tis Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbull,</hi> in his <hi>Animadverſiones in lib. Novi Teſtamenti,</hi> pag. 313. <q rend="inline">
                        <hi>Ac cum videam ſummi ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicii viros in his temporibus &amp; Rabbinis funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a petere veritatis,</hi> &amp;c. But when I ſee in theſe times ſome Men of the greateſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſetch the Foundation of Truth from the Rabbins, I cannot but ſtick at it: for whence was the <hi>Talmud</hi> ſent to us, (they are the words (ſaith he) of <hi>Buxtorf</hi> in his <hi>Synagoga Judicia</hi>) that we ſhould give ſo much Credit thereto, that we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Moſaick Law either was or ought to be underſtood therefrom, much leſs the Goſpel, to which they are profeſſed Enemies? The <hi>Talmud</hi> is called a Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of Errors, and the foundation of Jewiſh Fables; it was perfected and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for Authentick five hundred Years after Chriſt, and out of it <hi>Maimonides</hi> drew his Doctrine, at all the reſt of them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot acquieſce in ſuch Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</q>—Gentlemen, either anſwer no more Queſtions about Religion, or take more heed to what you ſay: for your pleading for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm, from ſuch grounds, all may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive tends to caſt an Odium and Contempt on the Chriſtian Religion: Therefore I infer, your Proof for this Practice from the Cuſtom amongſt the Jews about baptizing of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes both Men, Women and Children, proves nothing; you were better, for the Authority of it, to urge the Decrees of Popes and General Councils; a Popiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation is as good as a Jewiſh one.</p>
                  <p>But however, you do allow that our bleſſed Saviour did add ſomething to this pretended Jewiſh Cuſtom, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>th not only put it <hi>in full force, but alſo made it a Conſignation or Seal of the Covenant; and this, ſay you, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrengthened by ſeveral undeniable Texts of Scripture, which Anabaptiſts themſelves can never get clear of; and ask them, they muſt either be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, or give ſuch a Paraphraſe as we do.</hi> The Texts are theſe: Firſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11,12. <hi>In whom alſo ye are circumciſed with the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made without bands, in putting off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh, by the Circumciſion of Chriſt. Buried with him in Baptiſm,</hi> &amp;c. The ſecond, that of baptizing the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Red-Sea, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. The laſt is the ſaving of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family in the Ark, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. But is it ſo indeed? did our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in inſtituting Goſpel-Baptiſm do no more than put a Jewiſh Cuſtom to be in full force, and make it a Conſignation or Seal of the Covenant? Were. you not learned and ingenious Men, I ſhould not ſo much admire at your Notions.</p>
                  <p>2. But the Truth is, in the ſecond place, if you had not told us in your next words, to what purpoſe you mention thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we ſhould have been at a great loſs about it, or not well have underſtood your Intention; but you, like the ingenious Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſoon inform us, and tell us what 'tis—<hi>i. e.</hi> you tell us, you urge not theſe things to prove any thing elſe, but the Parallel betwixt Circumciſion and Baptiſm, or to ſpeak (ſay you) more properly, the neceſſary continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the old Manner amongſt the Jews of continuing their way of proſelyting the Heathen.</p>
                  <p>3. Was it neceſſary then, that a human Tradition of the Jews ſhould be continued? I thought the Apoſtle tells you that Chriſt nailed all the Jewiſh Ceremonies of the Moſaical Law to the Croſs, and that they all ceaſed when the Antitype was come; and beſure had the Baptiſm you ſpeak of been indeed a Moſaical Rite, I mean appointed or commanded of God, it had vaniſhed with its Fellows: But 'tis hard Chriſt ſhould abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh all Legal Cuſtoms, or Ceremonial Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and yet confirm, with ſome addition, a Cuſtom of the Jews own inventing.</p>
                  <p>4. You do not ſeem to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your twofold Anſwer to the Queſtion; I thought you had brought thoſe Scriptures to prove Baptiſm the proper Antitype of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; but you urge the former old
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57438:4"/> Cuſtom again, ſo that here's no Scripture nor Argument brought by you to prove the thing in hand. As touching what you ſay of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel betwixt Circumciſion and Baptiſm ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing; if in ſome things there ſhould be a Parallel, it doth not follow therefore Baptiſm was the Antitype of Circumciſion. What tho Circumciſion was the initiating Ordinance of the Male Children into the Jewiſh Church, and Baptiſm is that initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ordinance into the Goſpel-Church; this doth not prove the one the Type of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>5. But pray, what is it that the Anabaptiſts can never get clear of, or being ask'd the Expoſition, they muſt be ſilent, or give ſuch a Paraphraſe as you do? I muſt tell you, I know no Text more full for our practice of baptizing Believers, than that in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11,12. We ſay from thence, that the proper Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type of Circumciſion in the Fleſh, is the Circumciſion of the Heart; and therefore not Baptiſm; tho 'tis granted by us, that in Baptiſm there is a Repreſentation of the new Birth, and Mortification of Sin, which Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was the expreſs Type of: And this cannot weaken nor ſilence us, but rather ſtrengthen our hands. All that can well be inferred from this Text, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11,12. where the Apoſtle mentions Circumciſion and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, is no more than this, <hi>viz.</hi> where Baptiſm is adminiſtred upon a proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it repreſents the Spiritual and Myſtieal Circumciſion of the Heart, <hi>i.e.</hi> that the Soul is dead to Sin, or that he hath <hi>put off the Body of Sins of the Fleſh by the Circumciſion of Chriſt;</hi> which may refer to the Power of his Death in the Effects thereof, by the effectual Sin-killing Operations of the holy Spirit on the Heart: And as we being dead to Sin, we are alſo buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm, both in the Sign, <hi>i.e.</hi> covered all over in the Water, which reſembles in a lively Figure his Burial, and alſo in Signification, <hi>i.e.</hi> the Power and bleſſed Effects of his Death, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been the Death of the old Man, or that Body of Sin in us; wherein alſo in like manner we are alſo riſen with him through the Faith of the Operation of God; and this is likewiſe held forth both in Sign and Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in true Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Now if this be not your Paraphraſe on this Text, we cannot help it. I know many Learned Man who own Pedo-Baptiſm ſpeak to the ſame purpoſe, nor is there any reaſon for you to ſay we muſt be ſilent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if we knew not what to ſay to this Text: But what is this for Infant-Baptiſm, or to prove Baptiſm the Antitype of Circumciſion? Doth Sprinkling repreſent a Burial? doth the Sign or Figure of Chriſt's Burial appear in ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a little Water on the Face, and as it is done to an Infant, in whom Faith and Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is not wrought? what doth there appear in Signification? Doth not the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſay, that <hi>Baptiſm is the outward Sign of an inward ſpiritual Grace;</hi> ſure that is but a mock-Baptiſm, where there is neither the Sign or Figure of Chriſt's Death and Burial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor tht inward Work wrought upon the Perſon baptized, which is ſignified or ought to be ſignified thereby, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſaid Perſon is dead to Sin, and raiſed up by the Faith of the Operation of God to walk in newneſs of Life.</p>
                  <p>But alas, this it ſeems is not the thing; 'tis not ſo much to prove Baptiſm to be the Antitype of Circumciſion, as 'tis to prove Baptiſm to be the continuation of a Jewiſh Cuſtom: <hi>for to ſpeak more properly,</hi> you intimate, that to this purpoſe, you mention theſe things. Sure all underſtanding Men, as well Pedo-Baptiſts as others, muſt needs loath your Notion; but I know you are not alone here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there are ſome others who have aſſerted the ſame thing; which perhaps incouraged you thus to write: But to correct your Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſilence you and them to, conſider what I and the fore-mentioned Gentleman have ſaid. Is it not enough that Infant-Baptiſm ſhould be built upon no better a Foundation than the Tradition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Gentile Church, and the Decrees of Popes and General Councils, but that it muſt alſo be grounded on the erronious Cuſtoms of the Jewiſh <hi>Talmud?</hi> But to proceed, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57438:4"/> Circumciſion may anſwer, or run Parallel with Baptiſm, you bring in the Practice of ſome Heathen Nations who circumciſed their Females; we ſhall have it anon; the truth is, the Proof and Explanation of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm ſhall be ſufficiently made out before you have done; if fabulous and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Traditions of Jews, Heathens, and Apoſtate Chriſtians will do it; but if no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Authority or Proof can be brought for it than what is contained in your <hi>Mercury,</hi> 'tis time for all good Chriſtians with Shame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to caſt it off. Should I tell my. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der why ſome Heathens circumciſed their Females, it might greatly expoſe you. But to cloſe with your firſt Queſtion, take what Dr. <hi>Jer. Taylor,</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Down,</hi> hath ſaid upon this Conceit, <hi>i.e.</hi> that Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion figured Baptiſm; there are his words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">The Argument, ſaith he, from Circumciſion is invalid upon infinite Configurations: Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and Types prove nothing unleſs a Command go along with them, or ſome Expreſs to ſignify ſuch to be their purpoſe: for the Deluge of Waters and the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> were Figures of Baptiſm, ſaith <hi>Peter.</hi> If therefore the Circumſtances of the one ſhould be drawn to the other, we ſhould make Baptiſm a Prodigy rather than a Rite. The Paſchal Lamb was a Figure of the Euchariſt, which ſucceds the other, as Baptiſm doth to Circumciſion: but becauſe there was in the Manducation of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb no Preſcription of Sacramental Drink, ſhall we thence conclude that the Euchariſt is to be adminiſtred in one kind? And even in the very inſtance of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, ſuppoſe a Correſpondency of the Analogy between Circumciſion and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, yet their is no Correſpondency of Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; for tho it be granted, that both of them did conſign the Covenant of Faith, yet there is nothing in the Circumſtances of Children being circumciſed that ſo concerns that Myſtery; but that it might very well be given to Men of Reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Circumciſion leſt a Character in the Fleſh, which being imprinted upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, did its work to them when they came to Age; and ſuch a Character was neceſſary, becauſe there was no word added to the Sign; but Baptiſm imprints nothing that remains on the Body; and if it leaves a Character at all, it is upon the Soul to which the word is added, which is as much a part of the Sacrament as the Sign it ſelf; for both which Reaſons it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that the Party baptized ſhould be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Reaſon, that they may be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both of the Word and of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Impreſs-upon the Spirit: Since therefore the Reaſon of the Parity does wholly fail, there is nothing left to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a neceſſity of complying in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Age, any more than in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Annexes of Types: Then the Infant muſt alſo preciſely be baptized upon the eighth day, and Females muſt not be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized at all, becauſe not circumciſed; but it were more proper, if we would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it a right, to proſecute the Analogy from the Type to the Antitype, by the way for Letter and Spirit, and Signification; and as Circumciſion figures Baptiſm, ſo alſo the Adjuncts of the circumciſed ſhall ſignify ſome thing ſpiritual in the Adherence of Baptiſm; and therefore as Infants were circumciſed, ſo ſpiritual Infants-ſhould be baptized, which is ſpiritual Circumciſion; for therefore Babes had the Miniſtry of the Type to ſignify that we muſt, when we give our Names to Chriſt, become Children in Malice, and then the Type is made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</q> Thus the worthy Doctor hath anſwered your Queſtion, and you too. If Circumciſion muſt be a Type of Baptiſm, he hath ſhewed how, and how not, if it be ſo taken; but the truth is, all Types ceaſe when the Antitype is come, the one muſt give way to the other; but Circumciſion did continue in full force ſome Years after Baptiſm was in full force; for Circumciſion ended not till Chriſt nailed it to his Croſs; therefore it could not be the Type of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: but how a Shadow or Sign ſhould be the proper Antitype of a Shadow I ſee not.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57438:5"/> But enough hath been ſaid to this, and I ſhould not have ſaid ſo much to it, but becauſe you Notion ſeems new to ſome.</p>
                  <p>As touching the other two Scriptures you mention, <hi>viz.</hi> that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.

I would have anſwered you that was but a figurative Baptiſm, and proves nothing; beſides, it would prove Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may be baptized alſo, becauſe there was a mixt Multitude as well ſo Baptized, as were the Fathers and their Children; beſides, much Cattel were with them in the Sea, and under the Cloud.</p>

                     <hi>Reply.</hi> If you cannot prove Infant-Baptiſm from Scripture, you are gone for ever; for this Argument of yours to prove it is like that of the Papiſts, to prove their Church the true Church, <hi>viz. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality</hi> and <hi>Antiquity,</hi> &amp;c. it was not the Practice of the Churches firſt planted by the Apoſtles, that's plain; and 'tis as evident other Errors were as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally received, and ſome very early too; beſides, you can't be ignorant how the Greek Church varies from the Latin.</p>
                  <p>But pray take what Dr. <hi>Barlow</hi> hath ſaid to this, a worthy Biſhop of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">I believe, and know, ſaith he, that there is neither Precept nor Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Scripture for Pedo-baptiſm, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny juſt Evidence for it for above 200 years after Chriſt; that <hi>Tertullian</hi> condemns it as an unwarantable Cuſtom, and <hi>Nazianzen</hi> a good while after him diſlikes it: ſure I am, that in the primitive Times, they were <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> then <hi>Illuminati</hi> or <hi>Baptizati,</hi> and that not only Pagans and Children of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans converted, but Children of Chriſtian Parents: The truth is, I do believe Pedo-Baptiſm, how or by whom I know not, come into the World in the ſecond Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, and in the third and forth began to be practiſed, though not generally, and defended as lawful from the Text, <hi>John</hi> 3.5. groſly miſunderſtood upon the like groſs Miſtake, <hi>John</hi> 6.53.

                  <p>Thus both your Arguments from univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Conſent and Antiquity, the Learned Doctor hath ſufficiently anſwered. And I rather let him anſwer you than to anſwer you in my own words, thinking what he ſays, may be more regarded by ſome than what I ſay. But you to prove from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that Infant-Baptiſm was practiſed inth firſt, ſecond and third Centuries, you ſay you are able to demonſtrate, that there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any particular Congregation of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts till about three hundred years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt; and ſeem to build much upon theſe three laſt Arguments.</p>

                     <hi>Reply.</hi> If you had ſaid there were no Baptized Congregations, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch who only baptized Believers, you had aſſerted a great Untruth, ſith all the Primitive Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Churches were ſuch, none being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Baptiſm for the firſt and ſecond Centuries, but the Adult, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch who profeſſed their Faith, (as in due time may be ſufficiently proved) notwithſtanding all your Flouriſh or Pretences; but ſuppoſe it be granted there were no Congregations till then called Anabaptiſt, what doth that ſignify? it was becauſe there were not till about that time any (as Dr. <hi>Barlow</hi> and divers others ſay) who practiſed Pedo-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: Baptiſts could not be called Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts or Re-baptizers till there were ſome who held for Infant-Baptiſm; ſo that this directly makes againſt you.

Nor will it ſerve your turn to ſay, it was inſtituted a-new as a Goſpel-Ordinance, becauſe you affirm Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm under the Goſpel was the Continuation of that old Cuſtom, with the <hi>Super-addition of the full Force of Baptiſm,</hi> viz. <hi>a Conſignation or Seal of the Covenant.</hi> Do you not intimate it was not inſtituted a new, but rather a Cuſtom continued? upon which you (with that Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſome others before you) ſeem to lay the great Streſs of your Infants Baptiſm. And if ſome Additions were made to the old Cuſtom, why might there not be ſome Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutions alſo? and if it were a-new inſtituted, it is all one as if it had never been in being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for the Right any have to Baptiſm and manner of Adminiſtration, and all things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to it, muſt of neceſſity wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the new Inſtitution or Law of Chriſt: If therefore Goſpel-Baptiſm wholly depends on the new Inſtitution, then the old Cuſtom is gone for ever (had it been a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Rite) like a Legacy bequeathed in a Will, made void by the Teſtator's laſt Will and Teſtament; though ſome part of the ſame thing may be repeated in the laſt Will, that was in the firſt, yet the laſt muſt decides the Controverſy: but in Chriſt's laſt Will and Teſtament, Infant-Baptiſm is not to be found, nor was it indeed an Ordinance or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God before Chriſt's time.

But how dare you ſay, the Church hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to diſpenſe with Dipping, and change it into Sprinkling? Who gave her ſuch Power? Where do you read of it? You call it a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial, but I am not of your Mind; I muſt ſay 'tis an Eſſential; nay, 'tis no Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm at all, if not Dipping, for <hi>Baptize</hi> is to dip, which to confirm I could give you a Cloud of Witneſſes learned in the Greek Tongue; therefore 'tis not the manner of the Act, but the Act it ſelf; to baptize is one Act, and to rantize or ſprinkle Water is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the manner of the Act of dipping, or baptizing, is to put the Body into the Water backward, or forward, or ſide-ways, or with a ſwift or gentle Motion. Dipping is dipping, and ſprinkling ſprinkling, which Act will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be baptizing whilſt the World ſtands. You ſay well, dipping or burying the Body in the Water, is a clear and lively Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Death, Burial and Reſurrection of Chriſt. And hence 'tis ſaid, that ſuch who are indeed baptized, <hi>are buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm.</hi> To which you might have added, 'tis alſo a Sign of our being dead to Sin, and of our <hi>being raiſed up with Chriſt by the Faith of the Operation of God, to walk in newneſs of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hence I infer, Infants ought not to be baptized, becauſe there doth not, cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in them that glorious internal Work of the Spirit which ought to be ſignified thereby; and as they for this reaſon cannot be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subjects of Baptiſm: So likewiſe it cannot be done by ſprinkling, becauſe that Act cannot repreſent thoſe Signs and Goſpel-Myſteries, which the Law-giver intended ſhould be held forth in that holy Adminiſtration.</p>
                  <p>But why do you ſay this is a circumſtantial Thing? Was not <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi>'s Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and that of <hi>

Or, hath the Goſpel-Church a greater diſpenſing Power in ſuch Caſes, than the Church had under the Law?—Suppoſe the Jews ſhould have changed Circumciſion, or cutting off the Foreskin of the Fleſh, to the paring the Nails of their Children, or to cut off a little Skin off of the Fingers Ends; would that have been Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion? no doubt a better Circumciſion than Sprinkling is Baptiſm.

Can an Infant ſent into a Mahometan Province, be more confident for Chriſtianity when he comes to be a Man, than if he had not been baptized? are there any Acts prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, concomitant or conſequent to this pretended Habit?

                        <p>I Humbly conceive, that no Man knoweth what is a Duty but by the Scriptures: And ſince Pedo-Baptiſm cannot be proved by the Word of God, as every Man may know, and is generally acknowledged by the moſt Learned Aſſertors of that Practice; it therefore plainly followeth, in my Judgment, that Infant-Baptiſm is no Ordinance of God's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but an Innovation.</p>
                        <p>I therefore ſeriouſly query;

                     <p>JUST as my Anſwer to your firſt <hi>Mercury</hi> about Infant-Baptiſm was finiſhed, and almoſt printed off, your ſecond Paper on the ſame Subject came to my Hand: And tho I was not concerned in the Paper cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Animadverſions on your other Mercury;</hi> yet, till a furthet Anſwer is prepared, I ſhall make ſome Reflections upon what you have ſaid in your pretended <hi>Reply</hi> to that Gentleman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Sirs,</hi> You go too faſt to conclude, you by that Paper underſtand wherein our ſtrength lies, as (by this time) you may perceive, nor don't conclude you have it all yet.</p>
                     <p>2. What you ſay about your pretended Proof of Infant-Baptiſm, from that unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Tradition or Cuſtom among the Jews of proſelyting whole Families to the Jewiſh Religion by Baptiſm, you may ſee fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered before I ſaw your laſt <hi>Mercury.</hi> Have you proved that Cuſtom among them was <hi>Jure Divino?</hi> or, if ſo, that it remained and was continued by Chriſt?</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="2" type="remark">
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly;</hi> What you have ſaid about Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, being the proper Antitype of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, is alſo anſwered: Nor does what you ſpeak of, Types and Antitypes, not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in every thing, help you. Have not we ſhewed the proper Antitype of Circumciſion in the Fleſh, is that of the Heart?</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="3" type="remark">
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly;</hi> As to you Logical Argument, (<hi>viz. An Ordinance once enjoined, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, is always in force; but the Ordinance of Childrens in covenanting, was once in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament enjoined, and was never repealed.</hi> Ergo).</p>
                     <p>We anſwer, If the Ordinance of Children in Covenanting under the Law, was Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, that Ordinance is repealed; Is not Circumciſion repealed?</p>
                     <p>2. If you ſay notwithſtanding, Children of the Fleſh, or the natural Seed, being once in the Covenant, and never caſt out, (by reaſon that Law or Covenant, for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenanting being not repealed) is always in force.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply</hi> 1. That the Old or firſt Covenant, for their Incovenanting is repealed is plain; he <hi>took away the firſt, that he might eſtabliſh the ſecond.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Alſo 'tis ſaid, that <hi>Hagar</hi> and her Son are caſt out, <hi>viz.</hi> the legal Covenant, and fleſhly Seed, and no new Law is added to bring them into the Goſpel-Church by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>i.e.</hi> the fleſhly or natural Seed, as ſuch. <hi>Now is the Ax laid to the Root of the Trees.</hi>

                        <hi>Fourthly;</hi> Your citing <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. to ſhew what Baptiſm ſeals to Infants, proves nothing. We deny not, but all who are actually in the New Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> by Faith ingrafted into Chriſt, have right to Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Salvation; and that that Covenant ſecures and preſerves them to Eternal Life; therefore the Children of Believers, as ſuch, are not in it: And if they are no otherwiſe in it than conditionally, that is, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ask you what Priviledg that is, more than what the Children of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Infidels have? for if they believe and repent, ſhall they not have the ſame Bleſſings &amp; Priviledges of the Covenant alſo? As to the Adult Profeſſors, we ſay, if they fall finally away, it ſhews they never indeed were in the Covenant of Grace. As to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult true Believers, the Holy Spirit ſeals Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Salvation to them, and they ſhall be ſaved: a ſign of what is actually in them, is held forth in Baptiſm, there being nothing ſignified by that Ordinance as to a Death unto Sin, but what they experienced wrought on
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57438:12"/> their Souls before Baptized; tho, 'tis true, they thereby, for the time to come, covenant to walk in newneſs of Life.</p>

Your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Zeal will not acquit you from a ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Tongue, and ſpeaking Evil of them you know not.

                  <head>To conclude with your Poſtſcript.</head>
                  <p>I Can't ſee Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> has done the Pedo-Baptiſts any Service, or that any Honour redounds to him for that Work of his.</p>
                  <p>How in the Goſpel-Church-State, the Promiſe runs to Believers and their Children, or Off-ſpring, we have ſhewed; And that Babes of two or ten Days old, are or can be ſaid to be Diſciples, is without proof and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional: What though they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Kingdom of Heaven, or be ſaved, Baptiſm is of a meer poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Right; that Argument, I tell you again, will admit them to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord's Supper, as well as to Baptiſm. And as for Antiquity, we deny not but that it was received by divers as an Apoſtolical Tradition, a little time before <hi>Nazianzen</hi> or <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin;</hi> yet that it was preached as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, before <hi>Auſtin</hi> did it, you can't prove, though we deny not but 'twas practiſed before <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Days. See Dr. <hi>Taylor, Lib. Proph. p.</hi> 237. <q rend="inline">And the truth of the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is, <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> as there was no Command of Scripture to oblige Children to the ſuſception of it; So the neceſſity of Pedo-Baptiſm was not determined in the Church till the Canon that was made in the <hi>Milevetan</hi> Council, a Provincial in <hi>Africa,</hi> never till then. I grant, <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> it was practiſed in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> before that time, and they, or ſome of them, thought well of it; and though that is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for us to think ſo, yet none of them did ever pretend it to be neceſſary, nor to have been a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Goſpel. St. <hi>Anſtin</hi> was the firſt that ever preached it to be neceſſary; and it was in his Heat and Anger againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who had ſo warm'd and chafed him, that made him innovate herein.</q> Thus far the Doctor.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Clemens, Ireneus,</hi> &amp;c. you make ſuch a ſtir about, is contradicted by Hiſtory. <hi>Clemens</hi> aſſerts who are the right Subjects; and in what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they ought, after due Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Inſtructions, to be baptized. See <hi>Jacob Merningus,</hi> in his Hiſtory of Baptiſm, <hi>p.</hi> 2. upon <hi>Cent.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 209. out of <hi>Clem. Epiſt.</hi> 3. alſo Dutch <hi>Martyrology.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in his Diſcourſe about Baptiſm, aſſerts, <q rend="inline">That it ought to be accompanied with Faith, Love and Patience, after preaching;</q> ſee <hi>H. Montanus,</hi> p. 45. and <hi>Jacob Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bois,</hi> p. 16, to 22. and Dutch <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrology,</hi> where <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Letters are mentioned to <hi>Polycarp Tralienſis,</hi> and to them of <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>

                  <p>All that we can find of <hi>Ireneus,</hi> is, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 39. <hi>adv. Haereſ.</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">That Chriſt did ſanctify every Age by his own ſuſception of it, and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude to it, all, I ſay, who by him are born again to God.</q> In all which is no word of Infant-Baptiſm: Unleſs you wiredraw Conſequences from his words, as you do from the Scripture, to ſupport a tottering Structure, built on a falſe Foundation. That <hi>Ireneus,</hi> or any other but <hi>Origen</hi>'s Teſtimony was in the caſe; You have Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> in his <hi>Diſſuaſive againſt Popery,</hi> p. 118. printed 1667, one of his laſt Pieces, ſaying thus, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">That there is a Tradition to baptize Infants, relies but upon two Witneſſes, <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Auſtin;</hi> and the latter having received it from the former, it relies upon a ſingle Teſtimony, which is but a pitiful Argument to prove a Tradition Apoſtolical: He is the firſt that ſpoke it, but <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that was before him, ſeems to ſpeak againſt it, which he would not have done, if it had been a Tradition Apoſtolical; And that it was not ſo, is but too certain, if there be any Truth in the words of <hi>Ludov. Vives,</hi> ſaying, That anciently none were Baptized, but Perſons of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Age.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as to <hi>Origen</hi>'s Works, there is cauſe to queſtion, whether they are to be regarded? for Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doubt about them, becauſe no Greek Copies thereof are extant. And Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> ſaith, that many of his Works are Corrupt and Erroneous, particularly in the Point of Baptiſm, and fell into ill Hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, the Learned <hi>Curce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus, Inſtit. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. thus ſaith, <hi>Poedobaptiſmus duobus primis à Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto nato ſeculis fuit incognitus,</hi> &amp;c. Pedo-Baptiſm was unknown in the two firſt Ages after the Birth of Chriſt, but in the 3<hi>d</hi> and 4<hi>th</hi> it was approved of by a few; in the 5<hi>th</hi> and the following Ages, it began to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received. And therefore (as afterward he ſaith) this Rite is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed obſerved by us as an ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, but not as an Apoſtolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Author, <hi>De peccato Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginis, Numb.</hi> 56. ſaith, <hi>Morem In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes baptizandi non coepiſſe ante ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium à Chriſto nato ſaeculum,</hi> &amp;c. That the Cuſtom of Baptizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, did not begin till the 3<hi>d</hi> Age after Chriſt; but in the two former, no footſtep of it doth appear.</p>
                  <p>And afterward, (ſaith he) <hi>Sine ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius [Chriſti] mandato introducta eſt.</hi> It was introduced without the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now let the Reader confider, if our Authority is not greater than the bare Teſtimony of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> a late prejudiced Writer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many Eyes are upon you, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers diſcreet Men think you have not done well, to reflect upon ſo great a Party of pious Chriſtian-People; nor
